## Formulas

**Sum of $n$ consecutive positive integers:**

$$1+2+ \dots + n = \frac{n \cdot (n+1)}{2}$$

**Last multiple of $k$ below $n$:**

$$\frac{n-1}{k}$$

**Relationship between GCD and LCM:**

$$\text{lcm(a,b)} = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd(a,b)}}$$

The product includes all prime factors of both, but possibly with duplicates. Dividing by $\text{gcd(a, b)}$ removes the overlap (the common factors counted twice).

**Sum of squares of n consecutive positive integers:**

The sum of the squares of the first $n$ natural numbers is the $n$-th **square pyramidal number**

$$1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2 = \frac{n \cdot (n+1)\cdot (2n+1)}{6}$$

The sum of $k$-th powers of the first $n$ natural numbers is always a polynomial in $n$ of degree $k+1$.

## Concepts

### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic 
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic or the Prime Factorization Theorem states that every integer $n \ge 2$ is either prime or can be represented **uniquely** as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

### Factorization
The smallest factor of any number $n \ge 2$ must always be prime.

### Prime Number Theorem
It tells us how many prime numbers are there up to a given number $n$. The prime-counting distribution $\pi(N)$ is defined as

$$\pi(N) \sim \frac{N}{\log{N}}$$
