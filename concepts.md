## Formulas

**Sum of $n$ consecutive positive integers** 
$$1+2+ \dots + n = \frac{n \cdot (n+1)}{2}$$

**Last multiple of $k$ below $n$**  
$$\frac{n-1}{k}$$

## Concepts

### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic 
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic or the Prime Factorization Theorem states that every integer $n \ge 2$ is either prime or can be represented **uniquely** as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

### Factorization
The smallest factor of any number $n \ge 2$ must always be prime.
